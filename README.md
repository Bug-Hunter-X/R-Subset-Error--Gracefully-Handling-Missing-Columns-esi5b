This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R when subsetting data frames using character vectors.  The provided code attempts to select columns 'A', 'D', and 'B' from a data frame, but column 'D' does not exist.  This results in an error. The solution demonstrates how to handle this situation gracefully using `dplyr`'s `select` function which provides more robust column selection.
